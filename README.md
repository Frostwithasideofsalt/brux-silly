### **Introduction**

 Brux (formerly known as XYG) is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime-based game development kit using the Squirrel language. The aim is to make development both easy and versatile, allowing games to be written by hand in a simple text editor or made in an IDE similar to Game Maker, and to allow games to be ported with little to no modification to the code, offering a "build once, run everywhere" development process.

Developers using Brux may freely make games without any need for paid license or royalties. Anyone willing to donate may visit my **[Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/kelvin)** or my **[Ko-Fi](http://www.ko-fi.com/kelvinshadewing)**.
